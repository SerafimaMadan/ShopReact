<h3>The project is an online shoe store. </h3>
The challenge was to create a working application. 
You need to start the server with the npm run watch command 
(do not forget to do npm install first).
The application contains the following independent screens (pages):
<ul>
<li>Home page</li>
<li>Catalog</li>
<li>Information page</li>
<li>Product Page</li>
<li>Basket</li>
<li>404</li>
</ul>
The navigation center of the application is the header and footer of each screen.
There is a search widget on all pages in the header. Search on the server works by 
exact color matching (case insensitive, for example, “black”) and by the content 
of the word for the name (case insensitive).
You can get into the basket either by ordering something, or by clicking on the 
basket icon in the header of the site.
If there are no goods in the basket at all, then there should not be a pink indicator 
with a number either.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
